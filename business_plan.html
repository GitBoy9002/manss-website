		<h1>Buisness Plan</h1>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Basic Outline of Company</h2>
		<p>Right now our world is very disconnected, and we want to improve that. Our company makes little translating robots that can translate any language to any language. Our company goal is to link together the world, and let more people be able to understand more people. Our company wants that in the future, more people will have this ability so everyone can understand anyone.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h2>What Our Robot Does</h2>
		<p>The MANSS company strives to connect people around the world, therefore, we made a robot just for translating. It’s compact so that it is easy to carry around when you are traveling and can also translate into and out of any language. Simply select a language and then talk  to the device. The robot will then translate the language and speak it aloud. This allows people who do to not speak the same language to still understand the message you are trying to convey.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Market Analysis</h2>
		<p>We are targeting people who like to travel a lot globally. Whenever people travel, they almost always don't understand what the other people are saying. Our biggest competitor is google translate, and we can not only translate instantly, but Google translate can only translate what you say to other languages, and cannot translate what you hear to your language you choose. We can do that.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Financial Plan</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Robot HW and SW was calculated from the average wages for electrical & mechanical engineers, and programmers.</li>
			<li>Office space was calculated through the scheduled amount of employees* a varying amount depending on the they’re necessary space per profession.</li>
			<li>The company plans to sell an increasing number of robots each year, increasing its revenue.</li>
		</ul>
